A data graphic is not only a static image, but it also tells a story
about the data. It activates cognitive processes that are able to
detect patterns and discover information not readily available with
the raw data. This is particularly true for time series, spatial,
and space-time datasets.
</p>

<p>
  Focusing on the exploration of data with visual methods,
&ldquo;Displaying Time Series, Spatial, and Space-Time Data with R&rdquo;
presents methods and R code for producing high-quality graphics of
time series, spatial, and space-time data. Practical examples using
real-world datasets help you understand how to apply the methods and
code.  The book illustrates how to display a dataset starting with
an easy and direct approach and progressively adding improvements
that involve more complexity. Each of the book’s three parts is
devoted to different types of data. In each part, the chapters are
grouped according to the various visualization methods or data
characteristics.

Along with the main graphics from the text, the <a href="http://oscarperpinan.github.io/spacetime-vis">book’s website</a>
offers access to the datasets used in the examples as well as the

<p>
A methodology for downscaling solar irradiation from
satellite-derived databases is described using R software. Different
packages such as raster, parallel, solaR, gstat, sp and rasterVis
are considered in this study for improving solar resource estimation
in areas with complex topography, in which downscaling is a very
useful tool for reducing inherent deviations in satellite-derived
irradiation databases, which lack of high global spatial
resolution. A topographical analysis of horizon blocking and
sky-view is developed with a digital elevation model to determine
what fraction of hourly solar irradiation reaches the Earth&rsquo;s
surface. Eventually, kriging with external drift is applied for a
better estimation of solar irradiation throughout the region
analyzed. This methodology has been implemented as an example within
the region of La Rioja in northern Spain, and the mean absolute
error found is a striking 25.5% lower than with the original
database.

<p>
This paper presents a new methodology to build parametric models to
estimate global solar irradiation adjusted to specific on-site
characteristics based on the evaluation of variable
importance. Thus, those variables higly correlated to solar
irradiation on a site are implemented in the model and therefore,
different models might be proposed under different climates. This
methodology is applied in a study case in La Rioja region (northern
Spain). A new model is proposed and evaluated on stability and
accuracy against a review of twenty-two already existing parametric
models based on temperatures and rainfall in seventeen
meteorological stations in La Rioja. The methodology of model
evaluation is based on bootstrapping, which leads to achieve a high
level of confidence in model calibration and validation from short
time series (in this case five years, from 2007 to 2011). The model
proposed improves the estimates of the other twenty-two models with
average mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.195 MJ/m2 day and average
confidence interval width (95% C.I., n=100) of 0.261 MJ/m2
day. 41.65% of the daily residuals in the case of SIAR and 20.12% in
that of SOS Rioja fall within the uncertainty tolerance of the
pyranometers of the two networks (10% and 5%,
respectively). Relative differences between measured and estimated
irradiation on an annual cumulative basis are below 4.82%. Thus, the
proposed model might be useful to estimate annual sums of global
solar irradiation, reaching insignificant differences between
measurements from pyranometers.

<p>
An analysis and comparison of daily and yearly solar irradiation
from the satellite CM SAF database and a set of 301 stations from
the Spanish SIAR network is performed using data of 2010
and 2011. This analysis is completed with the comparison of the
estimations of effective irradiation incident on three different
tilted planes (fixed, two axis tracking, north-south horizontal
axis) using irradiation from these two data sources. Finally, a new
map of yearly values of irradiation both on the horizontal plane and
on inclined planes is produced mixing both sources with
geostatistical techniques (kriging with external drift, KED) The
Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) between CM SAF and SIAR is
approximately 4% for the irradiation on the horizontal plane and is
comprised between 5% and 6% for the irradiation incident on the
inclined planes. The MAD between KED and SIAR, and KED and CM SAF is
approximately 3% for the irradiation on the horizontal plane and is
comprised between 3% and 4% for the irradiation incident on the
inclined planes.  The methods have been implemented using free
software, available as supplementary material, and the data sources
are freely available without restrictions.

<p>
This paper analyzes the correlation between the fluctuations of the
electrical power generated by the ensemble of 70 DC/AC inverters
from a 45.6 MW PV plant. The use of real electrical power time
series from a large collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same
plant is an important contribution in the context of models built
upon simplified assumptions to overcome the absence of such
data. This data set is divided into three different fluctuation
categories with a clustering procedure which performs correctly with
the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the time
dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of
the inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet
correlation depends on the distance between the inverters, the
wavelet time scales and the daily fluctuation level. Correlation
values for time scales below one minute are low without dependence
on the daily fluctuation level. For time scales above 20 minutes,
positive high correlation values are obtained, and the decay rate
with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At
intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the
daily fluctuation level.

<p>
  This paper proposes a method for the identification of different
partial discharges (PD) sources through the analysis of a collection
of PD signals acquired with a PD measurement system. This method,
robust and sensitive enough to cope with noisy data and external
interferences, combines the characterization of each signal from the
collection, with a clustering procedure, the CLARA
algorithm. Several features are proposed for the characterization of
the signals, being the wavelet variances, the frequency estimated
with the Prony method, and the energy, the most relevant for the
performance of the clustering procedure. The result of the
unsupervised classification is a set of clusters each containing
those signals which are more similar to each other than to those in
other clusters. The analysis of the classification results permits
both the identification of different PD sources and the
discrimination between original PD signals, reflections, noise and
external interferences.

<p>
The <code>solaR</code> package allows for reproducible research both for
photovoltaics systems performance and solar radiation. It includes a
set of classes, methods and functions to calculate the sun geometry
and the solar radiation incident on a photovoltaic generator and to
simulate the performance of several applications of the photovoltaic
energy. This package performs the whole calculation procedure from
both daily and intradaily global horizontal irradiation to the final
productivity of grid connected PV systems and water pumping PV
systems.  It is designed using a set of S4 classes whose core is a
group of slots with multivariate time series. The classes share a
variety of methods to access the information and several
visualisation methods. In addition, the package provides a tool for
the visual statistical analysis of the performance of a large PV
plant composed of several systems.  Although solaR is primarily
designed for time series associated to a location defined by its
latitude/longitude values and the temperature and irradiation
conditions, it can be easily combined with spatial packages for
space-time analysis.

<p>
The performance improvement obtained from the use of trackers in a
PV system cannot be separated from the higher requirement of land
due to the mutual shadows between generators. Thus, the optimal
choice of distances between trackers is a compromise between
productivity and land use to minimize the cost of the energy
produced by the PV system during its lifetime. This paper develops a
method for the estimation and optimization of the cost of energy
function. It is built upon a set of equations to model the mutual
shadows geometry and a procedure for the optimal choice of the wire
cross-section. Several examples illustrate the use of the method
with a particular PV system under different conditions of land and
equipment costs.

<p>
The irradiance fluctuations and the subsequent variability of the
power output of a PV system are analysed with some mathematical
tools based on the wavelet transform. It can be shown that the
irradiance and power time series are nonstationary process whose
behaviour resembles that of a long memory process. Besides, the long
memory spectral exponent is a useful indicator of the fluctuation
level of a irradiance time series. On the other side, a time series
of global irradiance on the horizontal plane can be simulated by
means of the wavestrapping technique on the clearness index and the
fluctuation behaviour of this simulated time series correctly
resembles the original series. Moreover, a time series of global
irradiance on the inclined plane can be simulated with the
wavestrapping procedure applied over a signal previously detrended
by a partial reconstruction with a wavelet multiresolution analysis,
and, once again, the fluctuation behaviour of this simulated time
series is correct. This procedure is a suitable tool for the
simulation of irradiance incident over a group of distant PV
plants. Finally, a wavelet variance analysis and the long memory
spectral exponent show that a PV plant behaves as a low-pass filter.

<p>
The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can
be estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid
Connected PV System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of
certain basic features of the system under study. Due to the
inherently stochastic nature of solar radiation, the question
``How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this location over the
next few years?&rsquo;&rsquo; involves an exercise of prediction inevitably
subjected to a degree of uncertainty.  Moreover, during the life
cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: ``Is the system
working correctly?&rsquo;&rsquo;. This paper proposes and examines several
methods to cope with these questions. The daily performance of a PV
system is simulated. This simulation and the interannual variability
of both radiation and productivity are statistically analyzed. From
the results several regression adjustments are obtained. This
analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity prediction and
performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical analysis of
the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method of
malfunctioning parts of the system.

<p>
A review of existing studies about LCA of PV systems has been carried
out.  The data from this review have been completed with our own
figures in order to calculate the Energy Payback Time of double and
horizontal axis tracking and fixed systems.  The results of this
metric span from 2 to 5 years for the latitude and global
irradiation ranges of the geographical area comprised between -10º
to 10º of longitude, and 30º to 45º of latitude. With the caution
due to the uncertainty of the sources of information, these results
mean that a GCPVS is able to produce back the energy required for
its existence from 6 to 15 times during a life cycle of 30
years. When comparing tracking and fixed systems, the great
importance of the PV generator makes advisable to dedicate more
energy to some components of the system in order to increase the
productivity and to obtain a higher performance of the component
with the highest energy requirement.  Both double axis and
horizontal axis trackers follow this way, requiring more energy in
metallic structure, foundations and wiring, but this higher
contribution is widely compensated by the improved productivity of
the system.

Several authors have analysed the changes of the probability density
 function of the solar radiation with different time resolutions.
 Some others have approached to study the significance of these
 changes when produced energy calculations are attempted.  We have
 undertaken different transformations to four Spanish databases in
 order to clarify the interrelationship between radiation models and
 produced energy estimations.  Our contribution is straightforward:
 the complexity of a solar radiation model needed for yearly energy
 calculations, is very low.  Twelve values of monthly mean of solar
 radiation are enough to estimate energy with errors below 3%.  Time
 resolutions better than hourly samples do not improve significantly
 the result of energy estimations.

This study develops a proposal of method of calculation useful to
estimate the energy produced by a PV grid-connected system making
use of irradiance-domain integrals and definition of statistical
moment. Validation against database of real PV plants performance
data shows that acceptable energy estimation can be obtained with
first to fourth statistical moments and some basic system
parameters. This way, only simple calculations at the reach of
pocket calculators, are enough to estimate AC energy.
