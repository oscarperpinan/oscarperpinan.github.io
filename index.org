     A data graphic is not only a static image, but it also tells a
     story about the data. It activates cognitive processes that are
     able to detect patterns and discover information not readily
     available with the raw data. This is particularly true for time
     series, spatial, and space-time datasets. Focusing on the
     exploration of data with visual methods, "Displaying Time Series,
     Spatial, and Space-Time Data with R" presents methods and R code
     for producing high-quality graphics of time series, spatial, and
     space-time data. Practical examples using real-world datasets
     help you understand how to apply the methods and code.  The book
     illustrates how to display a dataset starting with an easy and
     direct approach and progressively adding improvements that
     involve more complexity. Each of the book’s three parts is
     devoted to different types of data. In each part, the chapters
     are grouped according to the various visualization methods or
     data characteristics. Along with the main graphics from the text,
     the [[http://oscarperpinan.github.io/spacetime-vis][book’s website]] offers access to the datasets used in the
     examples as well as the [[https://github.com/oscarperpinan/spacetime-vis][full R code]]. This combination of freely
     available code and data enables you to practice with the methods
     and modify the code to suit your own needs.

  A methodology for downscaling solar irradiation from
     satellite-derived databases is described using R
     software. Different packages such as raster, parallel, solaR,
     gstat, sp, and rasterVis are considered in this study for
     improving solar resource estimation in areas with complex
     topography, in which downscaling is a very useful tool for
     reducing inherent deviations in satellite-derived irradiation
     databases, which lack of high global spatial resolution. A
     topographical analysis of horizon blocking and sky-view is
     developed with a digital elevation model to determine what
     fraction of hourly solar irradiation reaches the Earth's
     surface. Eventually, kriging with external drift is applied for a
     better estimation of solar irradiation throughout the region
     analyzed including the use of local measurements. This
     methodology has been implemented as an example within the region
     of La Rioja in northern Spain. The mean absolute error found
     using the methodology proposed is 91.92 kWh/m² vs. 172.62 kWh/m²
     using the original satellite-derived database (a striking 46.75%
     lower). The code is freely available without restrictions for
     future replications or variations of the study at

  Solar radiation estimates with clear sky models require estimations
  of aerosol data. The low spatial resolution of current aerosol
  datasets, with their remarkable drift from measured data, poses a
  problem in solar resource estimation. This paper proposes a new
  downscaling methodology by combining support vector machines for
  regression (SVR) and kriging with external drift, with data from the
  MACC reanalysis datasets and temperature and rainfall measurements
  from 213 meteorological stations in continental Spain. The SVR
  technique was proven efficient in aerosol variable modeling. The
  Linke turbidity factor (TL) and the aerosol optical depth at 550nm
  (AOD 550) estimated with SVR generated significantly lower errors in
  AERONET positions than MACC reanalysis estimates. The TL was
  estimated with relative mean absolute error (rMAE) of 10.2%
  (compared with AERONET), against the MACC rMAE of 18.5%. A similar
  behavior was seen with AOD 550, estimated with rMAE of 8.6%
  (compared with AERONET), against the MACC rMAE of 65.6%. Kriging
  using MACC data as external drift was found useful in generating
  high resolution maps (0.05o x0.05o ) of both aerosol variables. We
  created high resolution maps of aerosol variables in continental
  Spain for the year 2008. The proposed methodology was proven to be a
  valuable tool to create high resolution maps of aerosol variables
  (TL and AOD 550). This methodology shows meaningful improvements
  when compared with estimated available databases and therefore,
  leads to more accurate solar resource estimations. This methodology
  could also be applied to the prediction of other atmospheric
  variables, whose datasets are of low resolution.

  This paper presents a new methodology to build parametric models to
  estimate global solar irradiation adjusted to specific on-site
  characteristics based on the evaluation of variable
  importance. Thus, those variables higly correlated to solar
  irradiation on a site are implemented in the model and therefore,
  different models might be proposed under different climates. This
  methodology is applied in a study case in La Rioja region (northern
  Spain). A new model is proposed and evaluated on stability and
  accuracy against a review of twenty-two already existing parametric
  models based on temperatures and rainfall in seventeen
  meteorological stations in La Rioja. The methodology of model
  evaluation is based on bootstrapping, which leads to achieve a high
  level of confidence in model calibration and validation from short
  time series (in this case five years, from 2007 to 2011). The model
  proposed improves the estimates of the other twenty-two models with
  average mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.195 MJ/m2 day and average
  confidence interval width (95% C.I., n=100) of 0.261 MJ/m2
  day. 41.65% of the daily residuals in the case of SIAR and 20.12% in
  that of SOS Rioja fall within the uncertainty tolerance of the
  pyranometers of the two networks (10% and 5%,
  respectively). Relative differences between measured and estimated
  irradiation on an annual cumulative basis are below 4.82%. Thus, the
  proposed model might be useful to estimate annual sums of global
  solar irradiation, reaching insignificant differences between
  measurements from pyranometers.

  An analysis and comparison of daily and yearly solar irradiation
  from the satellite CM SAF database and a set of 301 stations from
  the Spanish SIAR network is performed using data of 2010
  and 2011. This analysis is completed with the comparison of the
  estimations of effective irradiation incident on three different
  tilted planes (fixed, two axis tracking, north-south horizontal
  axis) using irradiation from these two data sources. Finally, a new
  map of yearly values of irradiation both on the horizontal plane and
  on inclined planes is produced mixing both sources with
  geostatistical techniques (kriging with external drift, KED) The
  Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) between CM SAF and SIAR is
  approximately 4% for the irradiation on the horizontal plane and is
  comprised between 5% and 6% for the irradiation incident on the
  inclined planes. The MAD between KED and SIAR, and KED and CM SAF is
  approximately 3% for the irradiation on the horizontal plane and is
  comprised between 3% and 4% for the irradiation incident on the
  inclined planes.  The methods have been implemented using free
  software, available as supplementary material, and the data sources
  are freely available without restrictions.

  This paper analyzes the correlation between the fluctuations of the
  electrical power generated by the ensemble of 70 DC/AC inverters
  from a 45.6 MW PV plant. The use of real electrical power time
  series from a large collection of photovoltaic inverters of a same
  plant is an important contribution in the context of models built
  upon simplified assumptions to overcome the absence of such
  data. This data set is divided into three different fluctuation
  categories with a clustering procedure which performs correctly with
  the clearness index and the wavelet variances. Afterwards, the time
  dependent correlation between the electrical power time series of
  the inverters is estimated with the wavelet transform. The wavelet
  correlation depends on the distance between the inverters, the
  wavelet time scales and the daily fluctuation level. Correlation
  values for time scales below one minute are low without dependence
  on the daily fluctuation level. For time scales above 20 minutes,
  positive high correlation values are obtained, and the decay rate
  with the distance depends on the daily fluctuation level. At
  intermediate time scales the correlation depends strongly on the
  daily fluctuation level.

    This paper proposes a method for the identification of different
  partial discharges (PD) sources through the analysis of a collection
  of PD signals acquired with a PD measurement system. This method,
  robust and sensitive enough to cope with noisy data and external
  interferences, combines the characterization of each signal from the
  collection, with a clustering procedure, the CLARA
  algorithm. Several features are proposed for the characterization of
  the signals, being the wavelet variances, the frequency estimated
  with the Prony method, and the energy, the most relevant for the
  performance of the clustering procedure. The result of the
  unsupervised classification is a set of clusters each containing
  those signals which are more similar to each other than to those in
  other clusters. The analysis of the classification results permits
  both the identification of different PD sources and the
  discrimination between original PD signals, reflections, noise and
  external interferences.

  The =solaR= package allows for reproducible research both for
  photovoltaics systems performance and solar radiation. It includes a
  set of classes, methods and functions to calculate the sun geometry
  and the solar radiation incident on a photovoltaic generator and to
  simulate the performance of several applications of the photovoltaic
  energy. This package performs the whole calculation procedure from
  both daily and intradaily global horizontal irradiation to the final
  productivity of grid connected PV systems and water pumping PV
  systems.  It is designed using a set of S4 classes whose core is a
  group of slots with multivariate time series. The classes share a
  variety of methods to access the information and several
  visualisation methods. In addition, the package provides a tool for
  the visual statistical analysis of the performance of a large PV
  plant composed of several systems.  Although solaR is primarily
  designed for time series associated to a location defined by its
  latitude/longitude values and the temperature and irradiation
  conditions, it can be easily combined with spatial packages for
  space-time analysis.

  The performance improvement obtained from the use of trackers in a
  PV system cannot be separated from the higher requirement of land
  due to the mutual shadows between generators. Thus, the optimal
  choice of distances between trackers is a compromise between
  productivity and land use to minimize the cost of the energy
  produced by the PV system during its lifetime. This paper develops a
  method for the estimation and optimization of the cost of energy
  function. It is built upon a set of equations to model the mutual
  shadows geometry and a procedure for the optimal choice of the wire
  cross-section. Several examples illustrate the use of the method
  with a particular PV system under different conditions of land and
  equipment costs.

Lorenzo, *Analysis and synthesis of the variability of irradiance and PV power time series with the wavelet transform*, Solar Energy, 85:1 (188-197), 2010, [[%20http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2010.08.013][10.1016/j.solener.2010.08.013]]: [[http://oa.upm.es/4953/1/Perpinan.Lorenzo2010.pdf][pdf]] (rev. 2011-12-26), [[https://github.com/oscarperpinan/irradWavelet][code]], [[http://www.box.net/shared/eoumayg1em8g61c5urjy][data]] ::

  The irradiance fluctuations and the subsequent variability of the
  power output of a PV system are analysed with some mathematical
  tools based on the wavelet transform. It can be shown that the
  irradiance and power time series are nonstationary process whose
  behaviour resembles that of a long memory process. Besides, the long
  memory spectral exponent is a useful indicator of the fluctuation
  level of a irradiance time series. On the other side, a time series
  of global irradiance on the horizontal plane can be simulated by
  means of the wavestrapping technique on the clearness index and the
  fluctuation behaviour of this simulated time series correctly
  resembles the original series. Moreover, a time series of global
  irradiance on the inclined plane can be simulated with the
  wavestrapping procedure applied over a signal previously detrended
  by a partial reconstruction with a wavelet multiresolution analysis,
  and, once again, the fluctuation behaviour of this simulated time
  series is correct. This procedure is a suitable tool for the
  simulation of irradiance incident over a group of distant PV
  plants. Finally, a wavelet variance analysis and the long memory
  spectral exponent show that a PV plant behaves as a low-pass filter.

  The energy produced by a photovoltaic system over a given period can
  be estimated from the incident radiation at the site where the Grid
  Connected PV System (GCPVS) is located, assuming knowledge of
  certain basic features of the system under study. Due to the
  inherently stochastic nature of solar radiation, the question
  ``How much energy will a GCPVS produce at this location over the
  next few years?'' involves an exercise of prediction inevitably
  subjected to a degree of uncertainty.  Moreover, during the life
  cycle of the GCPVS, another question arises: ``Is the system
  working correctly?''. This paper proposes and examines several
  methods to cope with these questions. The daily performance of a PV
  system is simulated. This simulation and the interannual variability
  of both radiation and productivity are statistically analyzed. From
  the results several regression adjustments are obtained. This
  analysis is shown to be useful both for productivity prediction and
  performance checking exercises. Finally, a statistical analysis of
  the performance of a GCPVS is carried out as a detection method of
  malfunctioning parts of the system.

  A review of existing studies about LCA of PV systems has been carried
  out.  The data from this review have been completed with our own
  figures in order to calculate the Energy Payback Time of double and
  horizontal axis tracking and fixed systems.  The results of this
  metric span from 2 to 5 years for the latitude and global
  irradiation ranges of the geographical area comprised between -10º
  to 10º of longitude, and 30º to 45º of latitude. With the caution
  due to the uncertainty of the sources of information, these results
  mean that a GCPVS is able to produce back the energy required for
  its existence from 6 to 15 times during a life cycle of 30
  years. When comparing tracking and fixed systems, the great
  importance of the PV generator makes advisable to dedicate more
  energy to some components of the system in order to increase the
  productivity and to obtain a higher performance of the component
  with the highest energy requirement.  Both double axis and
  horizontal axis trackers follow this way, requiring more energy in
  metallic structure, foundations and wiring, but this higher
  contribution is widely compensated by the improved productivity of
  the system.

 Several authors have analysed the changes of the probability density
  function of the solar radiation with different time resolutions.
  Some others have approached to study the significance of these
  changes when produced energy calculations are attempted.  We have
  undertaken different transformations to four Spanish databases in
  order to clarify the interrelationship between radiation models and
  produced energy estimations.  Our contribution is straightforward:
  the complexity of a solar radiation model needed for yearly energy
  calculations, is very low.  Twelve values of monthly mean of solar
  radiation are enough to estimate energy with errors below 3%.  Time
  resolutions better than hourly samples do not improve significantly
  the result of energy estimations.

  This study develops a proposal of method of calculation useful to
  estimate the energy produced by a PV grid-connected system making
  use of irradiance-domain integrals and definition of statistical
  moment. Validation against database of real PV plants performance
  data shows that acceptable energy estimation can be obtained with
  first to fourth statistical moments and some basic system
  parameters. This way, only simple calculations at the reach of
  pocket calculators, are enough to estimate AC energy.
